What makes a Billboard top 100 song?
======================

What do words the titles of top 100 songs have in common?  How does this compare to general English language? What about the lyrics? What keys are they in? How long are they? Where are top 100 artists from? How old are they when their song is released? How long had they been making music?  How have all of these qualities changed over time?
In the complicated world of the pop music industry, there are plenty of questions. Though people are fairly good at picking out a good song when they hear one, it is difficult to explain what exactly makes it good.
This project attempts to answer some of these questions, or at least look for interesting trends in an interesting dataset.
